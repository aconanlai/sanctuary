    "en": "Sanctuary is a series of augmented reality site specific interventions created in order to aid in conveying how society can grow and learn to collaborate regardless of our differences for we all carry the same humanity. When accessing the Sanctuary website on mobile viewers are presented with a 360 video that mimics the specific location. However, in addition to that environment, there are pieces of graffiti art painted onto the wall of the virtual 360 environment. During the Arab Spring (2011), Egyptian civilians used graffiti as a mean to communicate important events in a very unstable political situation where official means of communication were rendered inaccessible. Following these events,different Arab artists Aya Tarek, Ganzeer and El Teneen practiced street art in order to record history and encourage people to fight for their rights. Similarly, in Sanctuary, the pieces of graffiti will defer from one location to another and will depict acts of growth, change, acceptance and collaboration amongst refugees and Canadians. The videos are accompanied with an audio track of a refugee sharing their story.",
